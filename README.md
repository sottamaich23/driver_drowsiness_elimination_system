### ✨ Features

  * **Real-Time Face Detection:** Uses `TensorFlow.js` and `MediaPipe` to accurately track facial landmarks and detect signs of drowsiness in a live video feed.
  * **Data Visualization:** Displays real-time drowsiness data on an interactive chart using `Chart.js`, allowing for a clear overview of the driver's alertness level.
  * **Proactive Alerts:** Triggers immediate audio alerts and browser notifications when drowsiness is detected, ensuring the driver is promptly warned.
  * **Browser-Based Access:** Seamlessly uses browser APIs for camera access, eliminating the need for complex software installations.
  * **Responsive Design:** Built with `Tailwind CSS` to ensure the interface is clean, intuitive, and works on various screen sizes.
